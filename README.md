# DNN based Virtual Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Vehicles: Focus on Local Reference Path Computation

This implementation showcases a vehicle lane-keeping simulation, where the vehicle detects lanes, predicts future lane co-ordinates in real-time, and generates a local reference path using a DNN-based model. The model is trained on spatio-temporal road inference data, utilizing sequential past road frames. Developed as part of Sarvesh Telang’s master’s thesis, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the VTG Framework in generating robust trajectories, even under challenging conditions such as missing lanes, noise, or sensor inaccuracies. Integrated into the CARLA simulation environment, the framework allows for comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance in a controlled yet realistic setting.

- **Blue Line**: Local reference path generated by the DNN model (used as input for the Model Predictive Control)  
- **Orange Line**: Static reference path representing the ideal trajectory the vehicle is expected to follow  
- **Yellow Line**: Actual vehicle trajectory followed after computing deviation from the input local reference path  
- **RGB Dotted Lines**: Detected lanes in real-time
- **RGB Solid Lines**: Predicted lanes based on sequence of frames
